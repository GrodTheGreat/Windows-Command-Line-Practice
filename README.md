# Windows Command Line Practice
This repo is a place to store some projects as I practice Windows Command Line

## Projects
1. **File Management Script**
   - **Overview:** Create a script that allows you to perform basic file management tasks such as creating, deleting, moving, and renaming files and directories.
   - **Skills to Focus On:** Basic commands (`cd`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `del`, `move`, `ren`), understanding file paths, basic batch scripting.
   - **Additional Considerations:** Explore wildcard characters (`*`, `?`) for working with multiple files, error handling in scripts.

2. **Text File Processing**
   - **Overview:** Develop a script to manipulate text files. Tasks could include searching for specific strings, replacing text, and counting words or characters.
   - **Skills to Focus On:** Text processing commands (`find`, `findstr`, `sort`, `more`), piping (`|`), string manipulation, batch scripting.
   - **Additional Considerations:** Learn about regular expressions for advanced string manipulation tasks, experiment with different text file formats (e.g., CSV, XML).

3. **Backup Automation**
   - **Overview:** Build a script to automate the backup process for specific directories. This could involve creating a compressed archive of the files and storing them in a designated backup location.
   - **Skills to Focus On:** Archiving tools (`tar`, `zip`), scheduling tasks with Task Scheduler, error handling, batch scripting.
   - **Additional Considerations:** Explore incremental backups for efficiency, encryption for securing backups, and logging for tracking backup activities.

4. **System Information Tool**
   - **Overview:** Develop a script that gathers system information such as CPU, memory, disk usage, and network configuration.
   - **Skills to Focus On:** System information commands (`systeminfo`, `wmic`), parsing command output, formatting data, batch scripting.
   - **Additional Considerations:** Consider building a user-friendly interface, explore retrieving remote system information, and integrating with other scripting languages like PowerShell for enhanced capabilities.

5. **Simple Automation Tasks**
   - **Overview:** Create scripts to automate repetitive tasks such as renaming multiple files based on a pattern, resizing images in bulk, or downloading files from a specific website.
   - **Skills to Focus On:** Task-specific commands or utilities, loops (`for`, `while`), conditional statements (`if`, `else`), batch scripting.
   - **Additional Considerations:** Experiment with different automation scenarios, consider user input validation, and error handling for robustness.

6. **Log Analysis Tool**
   - **Overview:** Build a script to analyze log files generated by applications or system processes. This could involve searching for specific events, summarizing data, or generating reports.
   - **Skills to Focus On:** Text processing for log files, pattern matching, scripting best practices, batch scripting.
   - **Additional Considerations:** Explore tools like `findstr` or `grep` for efficient log file searching, consider implementing log rotation handling, and learn about log file formats like syslog or Apache logs.

7. **Network Monitoring Tool**
   - **Overview:** Develop a script to monitor network connectivity, check for active network devices, and report any issues.
   - **Skills to Focus On:** Network commands (`ping`, `ipconfig`, `netstat`), parsing command output, error handling, batch scripting.
   - **Additional Considerations:** Explore SNMP for more advanced network monitoring, consider integrating with email or notification services for alerting, and implement logging for historical data.

8. **System Cleanup Utility**
   - **Overview:** Create a script to automate system cleanup tasks such as deleting temporary files, emptying the recycle bin, and uninstalling unused programs.
   - **Skills to Focus On:** System maintenance commands (`cleanmgr`, `rd`, `wmic`), error handling, batch scripting.
   - **Additional Considerations:** Explore disk space analysis for identifying large files or directories, consider implementing a scheduled cleanup routine, and learn about system restore points for recovery options.

9. **Interactive Menu System**
   - **Overview:** Build an interactive menu-driven system that allows users to choose from a list of options and perform various tasks.
   - **Skills to Focus On:** User input handling, menu creation, validation, error handling, batch scripting.
   - **Additional Considerations:** Implement a hierarchical menu structure for organizing options, consider adding color or formatting for a better user experience, and explore integrating with external utilities or scripts.

10. **System Health Dashboard**
    - **Overview:** Develop a script to create a dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of system health metrics such as CPU usage, memory utilization, disk space, and network activity.
    - **Skills to Focus On:** Data collection from system commands and utilities, data visualization, scripting best practices, batch scripting.
    - **Additional Considerations:** Explore GUI frameworks for creating a graphical dashboard, consider implementing real-time monitoring capabilities, and integrate with external APIs or services for extended functionality.
